## Description
Books Reviews Website, that fetches book data from an API which shows on the card components dynamically. The Reviews button takes you to another component which takes the bookTitle from the first API and loads it into a API from NYTimes that fetches reviews for that particular book. On the reviews page there is also a form that allows the user to enter their own review of the book, this is saved to local storage and once the page is refreshed it loads it to the page to show the user review aswell.
